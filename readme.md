# C# Extension Methods

Welcome to the **extensionmethods** repository! This repository serves as a guide and reference for creating extension methods in C#. Extension methods are a powerful feature in C# that allow you to add new methods to existing types without modifying them, providing a convenient way to extend the functionality of classes and interfaces.

## What are Extension Methods?

Extension methods enable you to "add" methods to existing types without creating a new derived type, recompiling, or otherwise modifying the original type. They are defined as static methods but are called by using instance method syntax. Extension methods are particularly useful for adding methods to sealed types or types that you don't have access to the source code.

## Getting Started

To start using extension methods in your C# projects, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/extensionmethods.git
   ```

2. **Explore the Examples**:
   - Browse through the code examples provided in this repository to understand how extension methods are defined and used.
   - Each example demonstrates different scenarios and best practices for creating extension methods in C#.

3. **Integrate into Your Projects**:
   - Incorporate extension methods into your own projects by following the patterns and techniques demonstrated in the examples.
   - Feel free to modify and extend the provided examples to suit your specific requirements.
